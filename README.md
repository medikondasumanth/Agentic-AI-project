# Agentic-AI-project

This project demonstrates the implementation of an **Agentic AI system** using the [phi](https://pypi.org/project/phi/) framework.  
The system is designed as a **multi-agent architecture**, where specialized agents collaborate to answer user queries by reasoning, delegating tasks, and using external tools.
